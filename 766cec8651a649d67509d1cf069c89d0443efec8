      "message": "The code is basically adding a new `isRegistered` check and this will be used by the actual app before sending subscription. That is the logic, right? I have not had a great deal of context.\n\nI liked the idea that simply checking if the `XApp` is registered and then potentially retrying the subscription by the users of the framework is an easier way to go right now.",

Otherwise, xapp has to keep sending REST request to appmgr to check.\n\nThere is another MR to kpimon-go but this one needs to be merged first.",
